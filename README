osql
====

osql is an Oracle command-line interface alternative to the stock
sqlplus shell.

Especially "modern" UNIX conveniences like readline input and dynamic
output formatting are the main focus. Furthermore, osql is aimed at
DBAs and provides several shortcuts for common tasks.

Functionality for normal users may be implemented later, but currently
is not the primary goal. Currently, itâ€™s not even pos- sible to
logon as user (i.e., without preliminary or SYSDBA authentication).

osql is inspired by and aims to feel like the "psql" shell from the
PostgreSQL project.
